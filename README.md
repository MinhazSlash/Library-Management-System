# Library-Management-System Using Data Structure
<br>
1. Linked List: A dynamic data structure for storing book details, where each node holds book information and a pointer to the next node, enabling efficient insertion and deletion.
<br>
2. Doubly Linked List: Used for efficient traversal in both directions (forward and backward), allowing easier management of book records.
<br>
3. Merge Sort: A sorting algorithm applied to organize books by title or year, ensuring ordered library data.
<br>
4. Stack: Implements the undo mechanism. A stack stores previous states of the book list, enabling easy rollback of changes like adding or removing books.
<br>
5. Queue: Used for managing books waiting for a return. The queue ensures that books are returned in the order they were borrowed (FIFO - First In, First Out).
<br>
6. Dynamic Memory Allocation: Allocates memory dynamically for nodes and arrays, optimizing memory usage and flexibility during runtime.
